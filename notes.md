# Notes

## How to do formulas
* Perhaps use a trigger to update a column. 
* How to handle multiple formulas in a row? Programatically generate a PL/SQL function for the trigger? 

## How to do rollups.
May have to become postgresql specific
1. Build a pivot using a crosstab query perhaps as a view
1. Use a ROLLUP to define the rollup.

## How to do trees
* Use a closure tabel
